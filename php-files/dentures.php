            <h3>Importance of Replacing Missing Teeth</h3>

            <div class="col-md-12">
          <div class="text-box">
           <p style="text-align: justify;">If a patient loses even one tooth, their oral health can be adversely impacted. Following advanced tooth loss, it can be difficult for a patient to speak clearly, chew a variety of nutritious foods, and smile with confidence. Your oral and overall health can be seriously diminished if teeth go unreplaced. That’s why the Sriram Dental team is here to help you restore your smile to full form and function.  </p>

            <h3>Partial Dentures</h3>
            <div class="col-md-12">
          <div class="text-box">

            <p style="text-align: justify;">If you need to replace numerous consecutive and nonconsecutive teeth, a partial denture may be recommended. Sometimes referred to simply as partials, these prosthetics are crafted to fit snuggly between remaining teeth. A denture base is formed to fit into the gaps in your smile, and the entire partial denture is supported by clasps that attach to your healthy dental structures.</p>

            <h3>Full Dentures</h3>
            <div class="col-md-12">
          <div class="text-box">

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Full dentures are similarly made, using a base material to support an entire row of replacement teeth. Because there no healthy teeth are remaining to provide support, the denture base is molded to fit firmly against the gum line. This close fit creates suction between the gums and dentures that will hold it in place. For added stability, some patients prefer to use a small amount of denture adhesive.</p>

            <h3>Implant Dentures</h3>
            <div class="col-md-12">
          <div class="text-box">

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Traditional dentures can effectively restore about 20% of natural chewing ability. For those patients who want a restoration that offers improved stability, an implant-supported partial or full denture may be a better option. Implant-supported dentures can restore about 70% of chewing function, allowing patients to consume a greater variety of foods. A dental implant retained partial or full denture will look much like traditional dentures, but rather than relying on healthy oral structures for support, the implants are fused to between three and six strategically positioned dental implant posts. The process takes a little longer, but once in place, you’ll be able to keep your implant denture for two decades or longer.</p>

            <h3>Caring for Your Dentures</h3>
            <div class="col-md-12">
          <div class="text-box">

            <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a removable partial or full denture, you should remove and brush the prosthetic at night before going to sleep. Then, store the denture in cool water or cleaning solution overnight. For best results, brush or at least rinse off your dentures between meals. If you have an implant-fixed denture, you should brush your replacement teeth at least twice each day. Using a water flosser to remove plaque between the gums and denture base may be beneficial as well. If you have healthy teeth remaining, you should continue to brush and floss as usual. During your six-month dental exams and teeth cleanings, we’ll help you make the most of your daily at-home care to keep your dentures functioning as long as possible.</p>
