            <h3>How are Teeth Removed?</h3>
            <div class="col-md-12">
          <div class="text-box">

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Teeth can typically be extracted in one of two ways – through pulling or surgical removal. Pulling teeth is possible only after a tooth is fully emerged from the gum line. We numb the area around the tooth. Then, it is shifted back and forth until it breaks free from the supportive structures. Surgical removal may include a number of different steps. Typically, we’ll need to cut away gum tissue to reveal more of the tooth structure. Some teeth can easily be removed at this point. For more deeply impacted or larger teeth, we may also need to drill into the supportive bone structures or break the tooth into smaller, more easily extracted pieces.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Following root canal therapy, you should experience immediate relief from any tooth pain or dental sensitivity you experienced prior to treatment. Some patients do have swelling around the treated tooth and sensitivity for the first few days, but the majority of patients feel back to normal right away. If you do continue to experience toothache or sensitivity, you should reach out to our team right away.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
          <div class="text-box">

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Some teeth that we remove, like wisdom teeth and primary teeth, don’t need to be replaced. Teeth lost due to trauma or decay, will typically need to be restored. We offer a variety of tooth replacement options, and we’ll work with you to develop your restoration plan before we ever remove your tooth. Our skilled team can provide both traditional and implant supported tooth replacement using dental crowns, bridges, partials, and full dentures.</p>
